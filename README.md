1. The whole of the process:
    1) Class_director create the teaching requirement
    2) Teacher submit their teaching request
    3) The teaching request should be approved or rejected by PTT_director before could be seen by admin.
    4) The admin will match the request and requirement.

2. Class"Process" is to show the process that happened during the process of the using. 
    It might be not exist here,  probably could be used in logic process part.
3. Class "ListOfClasses" and "ListOfRequirement" actually are a little bit repeat. 
    They are the similar things, it is the class director create the teaching requirement.
    But I think that we may need to let the class director see all of the class and choose some of them as requirement.
    Also, another reason we need both is we can let the class director see all of the classes at first.
4. Method"write" could show the detail.
5. Some methods are not used, like some setter.
6. If there are any other method you need in the controller, you can add it as you like.
